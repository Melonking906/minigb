# gecko-minigb (aka minigb)

![minigb button](https://github.com/ThatRoboticFish/minigb/blob/main/img/minigb.gif?raw=true)

Basic, simple and buggy (lol) retro-styled PHP7 guestbook script with """multi-user""" support and without mySQL. Based in the [Flat-File Guestbook Script](https://github.com/taufik-nurrohman/flat-file-guestbook) code and on IglooGB.

NOTE: This script is currently in alpha and is not recommended for use on large websites.

# Installation

## Pre-requirements

* PHP 7.x
* A webserver w/ PHP support (e.g. [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), [nginx](https://nginx.org/), [lighttpd](https://lighttpd.net/))

Download this script from the Releases page (or you can just clone/download this entire repository if you wish) and upload it to your web server in a directory called "gb" or similar.

After you have done the above, you will need to change your default username in the "cfg.php" file and rename the "style_example.css" and "entries_example.txt" files to your new current minigb default username (e.g. "entries_penguin.txt" and "style_penguin.css").

You can now visit your guestbook in your web browser by going to the IP address/domain of your web server and on the directory where you have installed your guestbook (example: http://192.168.1.7/gb/).

To add a new user you will need to create a new file called "entries_newusername.txt" and "style_newusername.css" (where newusername will be the username of the new user). You will be able to visit them by adding a (?usr=newusername) in the URL of their guestbook (example: http://192.168.1.7/gb/index.php?usr=newusername).

If you are on UNIX, you must make the entries file writeable and readable for everyone (0666), otherwise PHP will not be able to write new entries.

*WARNING: This script currently has a small problem displaying entries if the text file containing them (entries_username.txt) is edited incorrectly or in other character set than UTF-8. I recommend that you back up your entries before modifying or deleting any lines.*
